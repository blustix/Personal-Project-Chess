# Personal-Project-Chess
This is a chess AI and Game.
The first 3 files, Main, Eval, and Piece allow the user to play a game of chess vs an AI.
The Subsequent 2 files, Main and Piece, allow the user to play a game of chess vs another player.
The files should then be uploaded to any compiling serivce, that can run java files, such as repl.it and or Eclipse, and then you can play!

RULES

The games are text based, and use console to read inputs and display the board.

The lowercase pieces are white, and the uppercase pieces are black.

When selecting a piece, input the piece (case sensitive) and index (which of that piece on the board) space seperated,
then the location you would like it to go with coordinates, space seperated, row first, then column.

The first row and column are indexed zero, the last 7.

If the format is not followed, an error will be thrown.
